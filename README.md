# Database-Management-Analysis
This is a memo and technical report of queries against an out of date database. From here, my team advocating for the usefulness of this data source, and the potential analysis, advocating for it's overhaul. 
We worked to create some standard tables of information utilizing the old information. The queries were done in SQL, and the data was then analyzed in Power BI. From here we created a memo with the key take aways. From there, we then built up a technical report that shows the details and approach to each Business Objective we were told to pursue.
